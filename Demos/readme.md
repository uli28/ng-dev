# Demos

Two types of Demos available:

- Isolated Demos located in `/app/demos/samples/<DEMOFOLDER>` of the corresponding module
- Demos build-in to the `demo-app`

The `demo-app` consists of `app.component.html` that defines the base structure and `primary router-outlet`. Subsequent routes are loaded into the outlet.

`/app/demos/demo-container/demo-container.html` defines a `left-menu` and a `nested router-outlet` where the individual isolated demos will be displayed.
