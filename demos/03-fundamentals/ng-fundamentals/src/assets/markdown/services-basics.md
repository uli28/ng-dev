- Services mostly are used to request data from api's, and provide that data to components using Angulars httpClient. They are also used to store data that needs to be shared between components.

- Services can be used as a reusable utility class, that can be used to perform some common tasks like guarding routes, intecepting http requests, etc.

- Stop the REST service mock (json-server) to show the loading indicator and explain why you use the subscribe to set the loading indicator to false.
